            <h2><a href="">How I Finished My Degree in Less Than 3 Years</a></h2>
            <p>It's possible to graduate college in three years or less for some majors, but few students do. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, just 41% of college students graduate within four years. Graduating on time or sooner — even by just one semester — means getting a jumpstart on your career and spending less time paying off student loans. Here are three ways you can plow through college to earn your degree and break into that job market more quickly.

<p>

            </p>

           <p>One of the easiest ways to graduate college early is to start early. Coming into college with credits allows you to start off at higher course levels and stay a step ahead. High school students can knock out a full semester's worth of required courses well before college even starts.

</p>

           <p>Taking a full course load all year with summers off means graduating in about four years. To graduate early, you'll need to take more credits during the school year and/or enroll in classes over the summer. It's important to keep your grades from suffering, so try to spread out your course load as much as possible, with night classes and summer courses.Most colleges limit the number of credits students can take per term to 15, 18, or 20 credits, depending on the school and whether it uses the quarter or semester system. In some cases, colleges will make special exceptions. Just keep in mind that some colleges charge extra fees for taking additional credits.</p>

           <p>Graduating early means spending less money earning a degree and more time earning a living. The year you shave off college becomes your first year on the job. Not only do you receive an extra year of wages, but you also potentially fast-track promotions and higher wages.While students who took four years or more to finish college are just entering the job market, the early graduate is hitting their second or third year in their field — and likely already seeking a new role and a bigger paycheck. </p>

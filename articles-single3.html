            <h2><a href="">My work as a Bartender</a></h2>
            <p>For some people, bartending can be a terrific job and great fit, while for others, it can be a huge mistake.<p>

            <p>
              <img title="Every Single Person" src="img/bar.jpg" />
              <span class="caption">A local Bar</span>
            </p>

           <p>Before you choose bartending as your career path (or even as a job that you plan to do for a little while before moving on to something else), you'll want to take a few things into consideration. This list covers 15 aspects of the job that those who haven't tried it yet may not have thought about.</p>

           <p>Many people go into bartending thinking that it’s a really easy job and that they'll just be hanging out at the bar all day. While it’s true that it’s a social job with a lot of fun aspects, it’s also hard work, both mentally and physically. Seriously. You'll be on your feet all day, you'll be dealing with a lot of people who all want your attention, and you'll constantly be on the go. When bars get busy, bartending becomes stressful. The ability to multitask without forgetting things is a must. Make sure that this is something that you are cut out for before you start bartending.</p>

           <p>Although you’re going to have to be nice to people, you'll also need to be careful not to be too nice. People frequently hit on bartenders, and getting romantically involved with customers is almost always a bad idea. If you’re not good at setting social boundaries, you’ll probably want to avoid this line of work. </p>

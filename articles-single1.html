            <h2><a href="">My Life as a International Student</a></h2>
            <p>If I dont go to the US, there are probably many other country as an Indonesian to go. I will list the reasons why and more things that counts as a factor<p>

            <p>

            </p>

           <p>Australia is the most popular country for indonesian student and also parents who sent their child to study. Aussie is much closer than us or Europe, so it makes mommy and daddy feel less worried about their daughter. Oz is very expensive both in tuition fee and living costs, however students are allowed to work up to 20 hrs per week. I have friends in Oz that work in McD and they said it was quite nice to increase their allowance. In addition, my friend as an intern who work full time can earn around 22 dollars per hour! Most of the student can obtain their bachelor degree around 3-3.5 yrs. Based on my experience, I believe around 80% of my schoolmates choose to study business, accounting, finance etc there. Also, searching for permanent resident after graduating from school is quite common for Indonesian student. Note that the admission rate is much less competitive.</p>

           <p>When Mr. Moazzam Malik, uk's ambassador for Indonesia, came to my campus, he said that every year Indonesia with +- 240 million population only send 2000 student to UK while Malaysia with much less population than Indonesia send 12000 students per year to UK. Indonesian student who took international high school certificate such as IB, could continue their undergraduate studies in just 3 year. For regular student may start at foundation level first which is one year extra time. Then, UK can offer master degree in just one year which is quite tempting for Indonesian prospective graduate students.UK is well known for their business, finance or management something like that.</p>

           <p>Engineering,engineering and engineering and oh medicine or chemistry too, its all about science. Living costs in germany is relatively cheap among other europe countries and the most important thing is a lot of universities gives free tuition fee, however you still need to pay 50-200 euro per semester for something i don't really know. </p>
